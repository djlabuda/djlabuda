- Hello, I am @djlabuda
- I am currently developing a Cosmographia project including a Earth to Mars Mission
- I am currently creating my own '.bsp' files as well as my own '.json' and '.py' files to utilize Cosmographia to produce 3D animations of the trajectory of the Mission.
- I am currently learning trajectory optimization, anmations using Matlab, and animations using Python as well.
- The best way to reach me is by email: djlabuda67@gmail.com
