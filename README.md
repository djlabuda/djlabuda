# Hello, I'm @djlabuda!

Welcome to my portfolio of ongoing and completed projects! This repository contains two key sections: **Astrodynamics Projects** and **Aerodynamics Projects**. These repositories showcase my work in space mission design, orbital mechanics, 3D visualizations, and more.

## Astrodynamics & Space Mission Projects

- **Earth to Mars Mission**: I’m currently developing a Cosmographia project that visualizes a mission from Earth to Mars. This project will incorporate real-world space mission data and produce 3D animations of spacecraft trajectories using Cosmographia.
  
- **Trajectory Optimization & Animation**: I am learning and experimenting with trajectory optimization techniques, as well as producing animations using MATLAB and Python, to visualize and simulate space missions and spacecraft movements.

- **Cosmographia Projects**: I am creating and working with my own `.bsp`, `.json`, and `.py` files to generate 3D animations of spacecraft trajectories. These animations are based on real mission data, and I’m using tools like the NAIF SPICE toolkit to model spacecraft trajectories.

- **Voyager Mission Visualization**: I’ve already developed a detailed fly-by close-up animation of Voyager 2, as well as modeling and visualizing the trajectories of both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 using SPICE kernels from the [NASA NAIF](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov) website.

## Skills and Tools

- **Cosmographia**: A powerful 3D visualization tool for space mission trajectories, orbital mechanics, and planetary systems.
- **SPICE Kernels**: Utilizing data from NASA’s SPICE toolkit to generate accurate space mission simulations.
- **MATLAB**: For trajectory optimization and visualizations.
- **Python**: For creating animations and performing data analysis.
- **SolidWorks & ANSYS**: I will also be sharing my prior work in CAD design and structural simulations.

## Repositories

Here are my active repositories related to my astrodynamics and other aerospace engineering projects:

- [**Astrodynamics Repository**](https://github.com/djlabuda/Astrodynamics): Contains projects and code related to space mission design, orbital mechanics, and 3D visualizations using Cosmographia.
- [**Other Projects Repository**](https://github.com/djlabuda/Other-Projects): A collection of additional aerospace engineering projects not directly related to astrodynamics.
