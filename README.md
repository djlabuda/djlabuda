# Hello, I am @djlabuda!
This is my portfolio of current projects I am developing. Contained within this portfolio is two different repositories consisting of astrodynamic related projects and other aerodynamic related projects.

## Dependencies 
* [Astrodynamics Repository](https://github.com/djlabuda/Astrodynamics)
* [Other Projects Repository](https://github.com/djlabuda/Other-Projects)

Here is some more information about my projects: 
- I am currently developing a Cosmographia project including a Earth to Mars Mission
- I am currently creating my own '.bsp' files as well as my own '.json' and '.py' files to utilize Cosmographia to produce 3D animations of the trajectory of the Mission.
- I am currently learning trajectory optimization, anmations using Matlab, and animations using Python as well.
- The best way to reach me is by email: djlabuda67@gmail.com
- I will also be posting my prior projects in SolidWorks and Abaqus.
- Currently I have replicated demos I have seen from other github projects.
- My own personal projects currently include, in Cosmographia, producing and developing a Fly-by close-up animation of Voyager 2 as well as the trajectories of both voyager 1 and voyager 2 using spice kernels from the NAIF Website.
